To running the code, it requires: 

1. all the python files (.py) in the same dire
2. python3
3. Numpy library
4. Input file: input.txt 

To run the code, put all the .py and input.txt in the same directory. Go to the directory and type "python main.py" in the command line. (You may need to type "python3 main.py", if you install both python2 and python3 on your pc)

After the code terminated, there will be two output files :

1. iteration_log.txt: time, duality gap at each iterations
2. solution.txt: All the results. e.g. correlation functions(primal variables)
